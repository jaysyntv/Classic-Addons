    *Automatically filter "status" and auto response whipsers from non friends  
    *Split Bnet and non bnet whisper sync handlers to patch the only sync vulnerability in sync handlers I found. This  vulnerability could allow someone to send fake world boss engage messages via non bnet whisper channel (even though DBM doesn't never send those kinda syncs from that channel). Now, all non bnet whisper syncs are automatically filtered through your group or friends list and rejected if sender not found on either.

    Added warnings and timer for Slow to Lady Serevess
